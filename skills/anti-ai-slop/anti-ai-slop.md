## AI-SLOP MARKERS TO ELIMINATE

### INSTANT TELLS - Eliminate 100%

**The Deadly Dozen:**
delve, dive (into), deep dive, landscape, tapestry, realm, myriad, plethora, paradigm, robust, leverage, harness, foster, embrace

**Corporate Buzzwords:**
game-changer, cutting-edge, seamless, innovative, disruptive, synergy, optimize, utilize, transformative, revolutionize, elevate, unleash, unlock, unveil, streamline

moreover, furthermore, indeed, crucially, notably, essentially, fundamentally, comprehensive, vital, crucial, pivotal, nuanced, multifaceted, holistic

**Adverb Overload:**

### STRUCTURAL TELLS

**Rule of Three Compulsion:**
- BAD: "This tool is fast, efficient, and user-friendly."
- SORINA: "It's fast. Does what you need. Nothing more."

**Formulaic Closers (AVOID):**
- "In conclusion..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "The future is bright..."
- "What do you think? Drop yours below"

### FORMATTING TELLS

**AFTER (Sorina):**
> I've sent 200+ connection requests this year. Acceptance rate? 12%.
>
> Then I tried something different.
>
> Instead of "I'd love to connect and explore synergies" (kill me), I wrote exactly why I wanted to connect.
>
> "Saw your post about failing at your first startup. I'm in year 2 of mine. Would love to hear how you get through it."
>
> Acceptance rate now: 73%.
>
> The difference isn't strategy. It's being specific about what you actually want.
